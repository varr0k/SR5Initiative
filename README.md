# SR5Initiative

A simple Shadowurn 5E initiative tracker, written in Blazor WebAssembly. Partly intended as a way to learn Blazor in the first place, and also as a tool for my own use in Shadowrun.

## Description

* Add/remove combatants to the initiative tracker
* Modify initiative values on the fly
* Next Phase button decrements all initiative values by 10
* Different color highlighting for PCs/allied NPCs/hostile NPCs (optional!) and any combatants with 0 Initiative remaining (not optional!)

**NOTE:** Not exactly a professionally-developed application. Caveat emptor!

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* .NET 5.0
* Blazor WebAssembly

## Notes

The app is designed to run as a Blazor webapp, and (hopefully!) includes support for Progressive Web App functions - that way, it can be saved to your device of choice for later, offline use.

Does not currently include tie-breaking functionality - this will be added soon!
